``The Web Browser As Synthesizer And Interface.''\\ 
}

The usage of two new javascript libraries called Gibberish.js and Interface.js allow the web browser to act as a synthesizer. Usage of websockets allows for efficient communication over standard AJAX procedures in javascript. These new libraries promote an improvement to Google's Web Audio API-- more sample--accurate timing as well as feedback networks. These two allow far improved latency in browser-based music synthesis. Today, both of these libraries are open source and drastically add to the Web Audio API.

{Enabling Multimodal Mobile Interfaces for Interactive Musical Perfomance}


A new mobile app called Control allows musical performances from a mobile interface. The application uses JSON to create complex structures capable of multimodal signals. MIDI signals can be sent wirelessly from a mobile device such as an Iphone aggregated from a variety of sensory inputs such as touch and accelerometer.
