Wright, Matthew James. {The Shape of an Instant: Measuring and Modeling Perceptual Attack Time with Probability Density Functions (if a Tree Falls in the Forest, when Did 57 People Hear It Make a Sound?)\cite{wright}

Probability density functions can be used to determine the likelihood that a listener will hear a sound's Perceptual Attack Time("PAT") at the same time. The functions can be used to show how different sounds' PAT can be actually estimated using shortest path algorithms.
