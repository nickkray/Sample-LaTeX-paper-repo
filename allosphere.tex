Using the allosphere, users can immerse themselves in spatially-visualized multidimensional data. 26 projectors and an array of speakers are used to create these auditory and visual projections. Research in computer music at UCSB has contributed to innovative new ways of creating these auditory representations.

N-dimensional data can be mapped and understood in the way a musician leads an ensemble. Using the allosphere, commanding complex quantum information is as intuitive as an artist paints a canvas.
