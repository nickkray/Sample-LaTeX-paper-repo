@@@ TODO write a short intro about Computer Music research at UCSB.
Mention the MAT program.  mention the allosphere.  Done.

@@ TODO: IF there are multiple areas of research or multiple researchers, and you want to organize it that way,
change the sections titles accordingly.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows.
Section~\ref{sec:Background} describes background that a reader needs
to know to appreciate our contribution.  A survey of related
work is either included here, or broken out into a separate section.
Section~\ref{sec:Results} describes our results, including a
description of our experimental measures, the hypotheses we were
testing, and the results of our data.  Finally,
Section~\ref{sec:ConclusionsAndFutureWork} presents a summary of our
conclusions and suggestions for future work.
